        <p>Mirror draw allows you to easily create a symmetrical picture. It lets
            you save your work as well as browse through other people&#39;s drawings. The full functionality and what
            the different buttons do will be explained bellow.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p class="header">The Mirror Draw page</p>
        <p>On this page, you will see a canvas and two dotted lines. The dotted lines are
            not part of the picture - they only serve as markings. Anything you draw will be mirrored horizontally and
            vertically with respect to the dotted lines. You can press the arrow buttons to disable or re-enable each
            line - if a line is disabled, no mirroring will happen with respect to it.</p>
        <p>You will find a number of things in the green toolbox at the top of the screen.
            Firstly is the number of your drawing - take note of it, as you will later on be able to search for your
            drawing using it. After that is the Line Width, which can be regulated by the + and - buttons. Next to them is a
            Colour Picker that allows you to change the colour you draw in. You can click on the Eraser to enter eraser
            mode. While in it, your mouse cursor will be different and you will be able to erase parts of your painting
            (mirroring still happens, even when in eraser mode). To go back to drawing mode, either click on the Eraser
            once more or click on the Colour Picker - your mouse cursor will then go back to normal. Finally, there are
            the buttons to Save your picture, Download it or go back to the menu. Saving does not happen automatically,
            so be sure to click on the button when you are done painting. Clicking on the Download button will also save your picture.
        </p>

        <p class="header">The Find page</p>
        <p>In this page, you can find a drawing by typing its drawing number in the text
            box and clicking on the Search button. Upon clicking, the painting with the specified number will be loaded
            (or an error will appear if the drawing number is incorrect). You can then choose to Download the image, or
            you can even paint on top of it by clicking the &nbsp;&quot;Draw on this image&quot; button - this will
            redirect you to the Mirror Draw page (the drawing number of your new painting will be different from the
            drawing number of the original one, so make sure to take note of it).</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p class="header">The Browse page</p>
        <p>On the browse page, you will be shown drawings in multiples of four. You can
            press the left and right arrow to go to the previous or the next batch of four drawings.
            The drawing number of each image can be found on top of it.</p>
